        <h2>Why Cancer Screening Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Cancer is one of the leading causes of death globally and in Kenya. However, <strong>many cancers can be prevented or detected at early stages 
            when treatment is most effective.</strong> Prevention through lifestyle changes and early detection through screening can significantly improve survival rates.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Key facts:</strong> Early-stage cancers are often highly treatable, and screening programs have dramatically improved outcomes in countries 
            with good screening access.
        </p>

        <h2>BREAST CANCER</h2>

        <h3>Understanding Breast Cancer</h3>
        <p>
            Breast cancer develops when malignant cells grow in the breast tissue. It's the <strong>most common cancer in women worldwide</strong> and 
            <strong>the leading cancer among women in Kenya</strong> (World Health Organization, 2023). 
            However, men can also develop breast cancer, though it's rare.
        </p>

        <h3>Risk Factors for Breast Cancer</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Age:</strong> Risk increases with age (most common after 50)</li>
            <li><strong>Family history:</strong> Having relatives with breast cancer increases risk</li>
            <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations significantly increase risk</li>
            <li><strong>Reproductive factors:</strong> Earlier menstruation, later menopause, having children later in life</li>
            <li><strong>Hormone therapy:</strong> Long-term use of hormone replacement therapy</li>
            <li><strong>Obesity:</strong> Excess body weight, especially after menopause</li>
            <li><strong>Alcohol use:</strong> Regular alcohol consumption increases risk</li>
            <li><strong>Previous breast cancer:</strong> Having had breast cancer before</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Breast Cancer Prevention</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Maintain healthy weight:</strong> Achieve and maintain BMI in healthy range (18.5-24.9)</li>
            <li><strong>Regular physical activity:</strong> At least 150 minutes moderate exercise weekly</li>
            <li><strong>Limit alcohol:</strong> No more than 1 drink per day for women</li>
            <li><strong>Breastfeeding:</strong> Breastfeeding reduces breast cancer risk</li>
            <li><strong>Hormone therapy:</strong> Use lowest dose for shortest duration if needed</li>
            <li><strong>Genetic counseling:</strong> If strong family history, consider genetic testing</li>
            <li><strong>Regular self-awareness:</strong> Know how your breasts look and feel</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Breast Cancer Screening Guidelines (Kenya & International Standards)</h3>
        <p><strong>According to Kenya Ministry of Health and WHO guidelines:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ages 20-39:</strong> Clinical breast examination every 1-3 years; self-awareness</li>
            <li><strong>Ages 40-49:</strong> Annual clinical breast examination; discuss mammography options</li>
            <li><strong>Ages 50-74:</strong> Mammography screening every 2 years (average risk)</li>
            <li><strong>Age 75+:</strong> Continue screening based on individual health and life expectancy</li>
            <li><strong>High-risk women:</strong> Earlier and more frequent screening recommended</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Warning Signs of Breast Cancer</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Lump or mass in the breast or underarm</li>
            <li>Nipple discharge (especially bloody)</li>
            <li>Changes in breast shape or size</li>
            <li>Redness or dimpling of skin</li>

        <h2>CERVICAL CANCER</h2>

        <h3>Understanding Cervical Cancer</h3>
        <p>
            Cervical cancer develops in the cervix (the lower part of the uterus). <strong>It is almost entirely preventable through vaccination and screening.</strong>
            In Kenya, cervical cancer is <strong>the second most common cancer in women</strong> (Kenya Ministry of Health Cancer Control Strategy, 2021).
        </p>

        <h3>Main Cause: HPV (Human Papillomavirus)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Cervical cancer is caused by infection with high-risk HPV types</strong>, particularly HPV-16 and HPV-18. 
            HPV is sexually transmitted and very common—most sexually active people will encounter it at some point. 
            However, only persistent infection with high-risk types leads to cancer development.
        </p>

        <h3>Risk Factors for Cervical Cancer</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HPV infection:</strong> Persistent infection with high-risk types</li>
            <li><strong>Smoking:</strong> Impairs immune response to HPV</li>
            <li><strong>Sexual behavior:</strong> Early sexual activity, multiple partners</li>
            <li><strong>Immunosuppression:</strong> HIV/AIDS, organ transplant recipients</li>
            <li><strong>Long-term contraceptive use:</strong> Slightly increased risk with oral contraceptives</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of screening:</strong> Not participating in cervical cancer screening programs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cervical Cancer Prevention</h3>

        <h4>1. HPV Vaccination (Most Effective Prevention)</h4>
        <p><strong>Kenya Ministry of Health Recommendations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary target:</strong> Girls ages 9-14 years (before sexual activity)</li>
            <li><strong>Catch-up vaccination:</strong> Women ages 15-26 if not previously vaccinated</li>
            <li><strong>Vaccines available:</strong> 2-valent, 4-valent, 9-valent HPV vaccines</li>
            <li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> 90-99% protection against covered HPV types when given before infection</li>
            <li><strong>Schedule:</strong> 2-3 doses depending on vaccine type and age at first dose</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Note: If already sexually active, vaccination still provides protection against other HPV types.</em></p>

        <h4>2. Safe Sexual Practices</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Consistent condom use reduces HPV transmission</li>
            <li>Limiting number of sexual partners decreases exposure risk</li>
            <li>Delayed sexual debut allows for HPV vaccination before exposure</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. Smoking Cessation</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Quitting smoking improves immune response to HPV</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines (Kenya & International Standards)</h3>
        <p><strong>Kenya Ministry of Health and WHO Recommendations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ages 21-29:</strong> Pap smear every 3 years (after 3 negative results, can extend)</li>
            <li><strong>Ages 30-65:</strong> Pap smear every 3 years OR HPV testing every 5 years</li>
            <li><strong>Ages 65+:</strong> Discontinue screening if adequate prior negative results</li>
            <li><strong>HPV-vaccinated women:</strong> Same screening age and frequency</li>
            <li><strong>Unvaccinated women:</strong> Screening is critical protection</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cervical Cancer Screening Methods</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pap Smear:</strong> Cells collected from cervix examined under microscope; detects abnormal changes</li>
            <li><strong>HPV Testing:</strong> Detects presence of high-risk HPV types</li>
            <li><strong>Liquid-Based Cytology:</strong> Modern Pap technique with improved accuracy</li>
            <li><strong>VIA (Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid):</strong> Low-cost screening method available in resource-limited settings</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Warning Signs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Abnormal vaginal bleeding (between periods, after intercourse, after menopause)</li>
            <li>Vaginal discharge (unusual color, odor, or consistency)</li>
            <li>Pelvic pain or pain during intercourse</li>
        </ul>

        <hr style="margin: var(--spacing-xl) 0;">

        <h2>PROSTATE CANCER</h2>

        <h3>Understanding Prostate Cancer</h3>
        <p>
            Prostate cancer develops in the prostate gland, which produces fluid for semen. It is <strong>the most common cancer in men worldwide</strong> 
            and <strong>the leading cancer among men in Kenya</strong> (Kenya Ministry of Health, 2023). 
            Many prostate cancers grow slowly and may not cause harm, but some are aggressive.
        </p>

        <h3>Risk Factors for Prostate Cancer</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Age:</strong> Risk increases significantly after age 50</li>
            <li><strong>Race/Ethnicity:</strong> African and African-American men have higher incidence and mortality</li>
            <li><strong>Family history:</strong> Having relatives with prostate cancer increases risk</li>
            <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> BRCA1, BRCA2, and other gene mutations increase risk</li>
            <li><strong>Obesity:</strong> Associated with higher-grade, more aggressive cancers</li>
            <li><strong>Smoking:</strong> Increases risk of advanced, aggressive prostate cancer</li>
            <li><strong>Hormone levels:</strong> Higher testosterone levels may increase risk</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Prostate Cancer Prevention</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Maintain healthy weight:</strong> BMI 18.5-24.9</li>
            <li><strong>Regular physical activity:</strong> At least 150 minutes weekly</li>
            <li><strong>Healthy diet:</strong> Rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains; limit red meat and dairy</li>
            <li><strong>Limit alcohol:</strong> Moderate or no alcohol consumption</li>
            <li><strong>Smoking cessation:</strong> Quit if you smoke</li>
            <li><strong>Tomatoes and lycopene:</strong> Some evidence suggests protective effect (cooked tomatoes)</li>
            <li><strong>Regular screening discussions:</strong> Know your risk and discuss screening with provider</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Prostate Cancer Screening Guidelines (Kenya & International Standards)</h3>
        <p><strong>Kenya Ministry of Health and International Consensus:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ages 40-49 (Average risk):</strong> Discuss risks and benefits of screening</li>
            <li><strong>Ages 40-49 (High risk - family history or Black men):</strong> Annual screening with PSA and DRE</li>
            <li><strong>Ages 50-69 (Average risk):</strong> Discuss screening; PSA testing optional</li>
            <li><strong>Ages 50-69 (High risk):</strong> Annual PSA and DRE recommended</li>
            <li><strong>Age 70+:</strong> Individualize decision based on life expectancy and health status</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Prostate Cancer Screening Methods</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PSA Test (Prostate-Specific Antigen):</strong> Blood test measuring protein produced by prostate; elevated levels may indicate cancer or other conditions</li>
            <li><strong>DRE (Digital Rectal Examination):</strong> Healthcare provider examines prostate by inserting finger in rectum; detects lumps or hardness</li>
            <li><strong>Transrectal Ultrasound:</strong> If abnormalities found on DRE or PSA elevated</li>
            <li><strong>Biopsy:</strong> Tissue samples if cancer suspected</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Important Notes About PSA Screening</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>PSA can be elevated due to benign conditions (enlarged prostate, infection)</li>
            <li>Not all elevated PSA means cancer</li>
            <li>Some prostate cancers grow very slowly and may not cause harm</li>
